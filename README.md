# Django Blog
My very first Django project. A simple blog application where users can create accounts, make posts, update and delete them, etc.

It uses a very simple Bootstrap design, as I didn't want to worry about the design on this project and wanted to focus entirely on Django. New users can register and
(if I remember correctly) they will also receive a confirmation email. They can also login and then make posts, update or delete their own posts, and more. It is mostly
composed of CRUD operations.

This is what the app looks like: ![Main Screen](https://i.imgur.com/KFRenIO.png) The Home page shows a list of all the posts, with pagination enabled, so you see 10 posts
per page.

Users can register and login:

When you're logged in, you can see your "Profile" page. This will show a list of all the posts you have created. These also have pagination, meaning you can only see about 
10 posts per page.

When logged in, you can create new posts under your name:

You can also Update or Delete your existing posts:
